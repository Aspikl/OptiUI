    <!-- Of the elements being described below each kind may appear any number of times and in any order -->

    <incompatibility name="Other mod" version="1.0-1.4" />
    <!-- States an incompatibility with certain versions of another mod to be abided by the Mod Manager; this mod cannot be enabled when the other mod is enabled. -->

    <requirement name="Other mod" version="2.5.1-*" />
    <!-- States a dependence on another mod to be abided by the Mod Manager; this mod cannot be enabled when the other mod is not present and enabled. -->

    <applyafter name="Other mod" version="2.5.1-*" />
    <applybefore name="Other mod" version="2.5.1-*" />
    <!-- If the specified other mod is enabled, this mod will be applied after/before it. -->

    <copyfile name="path1" source="path2" overwrite="newer" version="1.0" condition="..." />
    <!-- Copies a supportive file from the mod archive. If "path2" is not specified the file "path1" is copied, if it is "path2" is copied and renamed to "path1".
         overwrite specifies a controlled behaviour in case the target file already exists:
         "yes"   -> target file is overwritten
         "no"    -> target file is left as is
         "newer" -> target file is overwritten if its version is lower than the one specified by the version attribute
        
        If the condition attribute is specified the copying is only performed if the given condition is true. A condition can consist of another mod being enabled or disabled or a boolean expression combining multiple such conditions. Examples of valid condition strings:
        'Tiny UI'
        not 'Tiny UI'
        'Tiny UI[v3.0]' and 'Automatic Ability Learner[v1.1-1.5]'
        ('BardUI' or ('Improved UI by Barter[v1.08]' and 'Improved UI Addon - Juking Map')) and not 'Tiny UI' -->

    <editfile name="path" condition="...">
        <!-- Edits a file from resources0.s2z or one that has already been copied
            If condition is specified this editfile tag is only executed if the given condition is true; uses the same syntax as for copyfile. -->

        <!-- Files are edited by executing a sequence of steps, each being represented by one of the four elements below.
             All elements need a string as input, which can either be delivered as inner text node (between the <operation></operation> tags) or read from a file in the mod archive specified by a source attribute.
             Every operation interacts with a "cursor" variable which points to a area in the file and starts out at the beginning of the file. -->
        
        <find position="end" /> <!-- synonyms for "find" are "seek" and "search" -->
        <!-- Moves the "cursor" to the next occurrence of the source string
             OR as specified by the position attribute, possible values being:
             "start"     -> Beginning of the file (synonyms: "begin", "head", "before")
             "end"       -> End of the file (synonyms: "tail", "after", "eof")
             any integer -> Move forward the specified number of characters (negative values allowed) -->
        <findup /> <!-- synonyms for "findup" are "seekup" and "searchup" -->
        <!-- Moves the "cursor" to the next occurrence of the source string, but searching backwards. -->
        
        <insert position="after" /> <!-- synonym for "insert" is "add" -->
        <!-- Inserts the source string at the "cursor", either before or after as the position attribute specifies. -->
        
        <replace />
        <!-- Replaces the string pointed to by the "cursor" with the source string. -->

        <delete />
        <!-- Deletes the string pointed to by the "cursor". Does not require a source string. -->
    </editfile>
